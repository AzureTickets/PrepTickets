# Developer

## Setup

### Requirements
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
  * [Bower](http://bower.io/)

    `npm install -g bower`

  * [Less](http://lesscss.org/)

    Install: `npm install -g less`

  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)

    Install: `npm install -g coffee-script`

### Things to lookout for
**NEVER EDIT COMPILED JAVASCRIPT FILES**

CoffeeScript compiles to JS, but it will overwrite any changes done to the compiled JS.
You can tell a file has been compiled by CoffeeScript by the first line saying: 

```Javascript
// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.6.3
```


## Programming

### Running web server

To view the project, run this command (from the `/apps` directory):

```
  ../scripts/web-server.js
```

Then you can visit the project at [http://localhost:8000/index.html]


### Compile CoffeeScript

To compile CoffeeScript to JavaScript, simple run this command (from the `/apps` directory): 

```
  coffee -o js/ -cw coffee/
```

### Compile Less

To compile Less to CSS, simply run this command (from the `/apps` directory):

```
  lessc less/app.less css/app.css  --strict-math=on
```

## Testing

The following has been taken from (AngularJS docs)[https://github.com/angular/angular-seed]

### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`
