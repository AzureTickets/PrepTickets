## Setup

### Requirements
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  * [Bower](http://bower.io/)

    Install: `npm install -g bower`

  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
  
    Install: `npm install -g coffee-script`

### Things to lookout for
**NEVER EDIT COMPILED JAVASCRIPT FILES**
CoffeeScript compiles to JS, but it will overwrite any changes done to the compiled JS.
You can tell a file has been compiled by CoffeeScript by the first line saying: 

```Javascript
// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.6.3
```


## Programming


### Compile CoffeeScript

To compile coffee script, simple run this command (from the `/apps` directory): 

```
  coffee -o js/ -cw coffee/
```
